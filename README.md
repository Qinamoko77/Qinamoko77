One Pioneer One Sub-district is a Loving Service Area. 

Calculation of Monthly Income Results of Pioneers One Village One Pioneer on Each Daily Mining That Can Be Calculated and Also the Uma Metan Community Calculates Than the Tithes of One Pioneer One Village Service. 

 I. *Income Result Details*
*One Village One Pioneer Pioneer*
Given:
1. RKS: 1 Ã— 1 = 3
2. Number of Pa/KK: 3 Pa
3. Number of KK: 70/Hamlet
3. Number of Hamlets: 4 Hamlets/Village
4. Number of Pa: 840 Pa.

5. Basic Mining Value: 0.00000029 Ï€/Hour *(Calculating Initial Limit of Ï€ Token)*
6. Value of One Pa: 0.01 Ï€/Hour
7. Actual Mining Time: 60 Minutes.

 *So the result is:*
= 840 Pa Ã— 0.01 Ï€/Hour
= 8.4 Ï€/Hour Ã— 0.00000029 Ï€/Hour
= 0.000002436 Ï€/Hour Ã— 60 Minutes
= 0.00014616 Ï€/Hour Ã· 24 Mining Hours
= 0.00350784 Ï€/Day Ã— 840 Pa
= 2.9475856 Ï€/Day Ã· 2 Halving
= 1.4732928 Ï€/Day Ã· 2 Grace Period
= 0.7366464 Ï€/Day Ã— 30 Mining Days
= 22.099392 Ï€/Month Ã— 30%
=  6.6298176 Ï€/Month Ã· 3 Interests:

1) *Interest One:* 2.2099392 Ï€/Month For Uma Metan Community.

2) *Interest Two:* 2.2099392 Ï€/Month For Pioneer Village Development Fund One Village, One Pioneer.

*So the Result Settlement:*
1. *One-Stage Method-1 Pioneer Pi Coin Mining in the First Month.*
= 2.2099392 Ï€Ã— Rp. 4,712,385,000 (CGV)
= Rp. 10,414,084,336.992 Ã· Rp. 500,000,000/House Cost of 1 House
= 20 Houses Construction Stage-1
= 20 Houses Ã— Rp. 500,000,000
= Rp.  10,000,000,000/20 Houses
= Rp. 10,414,084,336.992 - Rp. 10,000,000,000
= Rp. 414,084,336.992 Remaining Development Funds Phase-1: 20 Houses In Each Month of House Development in One Hamlet of Pioneer Village. 

2. *Two-Stage Method-1: Quarterly Development.* 
= 2.2099392 Ï€Ã— Rp. 4,712,385,000 (CGV) 
= Rp. 10,414,084,336.992 Ã— 3 Months
= Rp. 31,242,253,010.976 Ã· 60 Houses
= Rp.  31,242,253,010.975 - Rp. 30,000,000,000
= Rp. 1,242,253,010.975 Remaining Development Funds in Phase-1 of Development of 60 Houses in One Hamlet.
= Rp. 1,242,253,010.975 Food and Drink Costs and Other Unexpected Costs During the Phase-1 Development Period.
